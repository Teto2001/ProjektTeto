2 Application Process
The implementation of the knowledge acquired during my study into practical work was a crucial 
criterion in the search for a suitable internship. Because of my fellow students in 
the "Medical Informatics" curriculum, the company IMESO-IT GmbH was brought to my attention. I sent an application and a resume along with a 
justification of why the company would be interesting for an internship in healthcare 
via email. After receiving a response, a choice was offered between two dates for 
an interview. The appointment on May 29, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. was selected. On 
that day Mrs. Claudia Hermes, the CEO of the company, was 
introduced. During the conversation, questions about interests and goals for the 
future as well as current knowledge about Python, SQL, and databases in general 
were asked. 
The CEO explained in detail various aspects of the business. Moreover, 
she presented a few ongoing and upcoming projects. At the end of the 
conversation, Mrs. Hermes gave a tour of the company and showed the various 
departments, including the statistical department where the internship would be mainly situated.
Additionally, a trial work day was arranged for Friday, June 7, 2024. 
On June 7, the trial work began at 11 a.m. and was scheduled for four hours. On this 
day other employees were met and a glimpse of the workday was provided before the start of the 
practical phase of the internship. 
A few weeks later a contract was sent out by the HR department, which 
was signed and digitally returned. Thanks to the extensive introduction, the 
thorough interview discussion, and the trial work allowed for a good 
impression of the IMESO-IT GmbH.
